  desc: "We\u2019ve discovered an abandoned city on Aridis named Vas Rakhar, and
    its water farms could be the key to our survival. Your task is simple: locate
    the pumps, fix what\u2019s broken, and get the water flowing again. Without it,
    we\u2019re not moving forward, so don\u2019t fail."
